When he's jumped by some gutter punks who steal his cash and his stash, he finds himself in deep trouble with his supplier (The Hangover's Ed Helms). In order to make amends, the small-time peddler must become a big-time smuggler by bringing in the latest shipment from Mexico. Enlisting his neighbors -- a cynical stripper (Jennifer Aniston), a streetwise teen (Emma Roberts) and a wannabe customer (Will Poulter) -- he comes up with a foolproof plan. One fake wife, two pretend kids and a ginormous shiny RV later, \"\"the Millers\"\" are headed south of the border for a Fourth of July weekend that's sure to end with a bang or two!","category":""}}

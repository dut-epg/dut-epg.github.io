Out of desperation he contracts the inventor of the process (Oscar\u00ae-nominee Tom Wilkinson) to have Clementine removed from his own mind. But as Joel's memories of Clementine progressively disappear he rediscovers the passion they once had. Charlie Kaufman won an Oscar\u00ae for his (very) original screenplay. A spellbinding and visually stunning masterwork, this surreal romance also stars Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo.","category":""}}

He tells the surprising and deeply personal story of the changes he has seen, of the pioneering conservationists with whom he has worked - and of the global revolution in attitudes towards nature that has taken place within the last six decades. In a journey that takes him from the London Zoo to the jungles of Borneo, Attenborough reveals what inspired him to become a conservationist. He remembers classic encounters with mountain gorillas, blue whales and the giant tortoise, Lonesome George. These are all characters that have helped to change public attitudes to the natural world.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="39" start="20221229100000 +0000" stop="20221229112500 +0000" catchup-id="900868665"><title>Planes</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/Cyu2Eh9CdN1FhqAghBDDTNi2jmOMS1Bf9ApqKpX6DMmjs/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>Disney animation set in the world of Pixar's Cars.

The island and its people gave her confidence and support. A highlight of Ben's journey is a visit to Iona, the island after which he named his daughter.

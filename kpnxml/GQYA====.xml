Ruairidh has also experimented with smoked black pepper which adds a kick to the B&amp;B dessert. Debbie found a love of the kitchen cooking for her late husband Paul Daniels, so fits right at home with chef Alex in the B&amp;B kitchen. Here they whip up a seafood feast and a sweet treat incorporating the locally smoked black pepper.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="40" start="20221230050000 +0000" stop="20221230063000 +0000" catchup-id="900916599"><title>This is BBC Two</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/edkylXqikseZ2qhmwOfYACvdMP8aEbtlysOd7MA4u9CQ/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>Highlights of programmes on BBC Two.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="40" start="20221230063000 +0000" stop="20221230073000 +0000" catchup-id="900916602"><title>My Life at Christmas with Sally Phillips</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/0rSuPSQqGkqdKIlAQ2juCeANHy2pr7BCHIbNODh29C6c/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>Sally Phillips visits the home of Strictly Come Dancing head judge Shirley Ballas to hear how Christmas has marked her journey from her childhood in the Wirral to huge acclaim across the world as a professional dance champion.

The next morning, the car was found abandoned, balanced precariously on the edge of a quarry. Ten days later, Agatha was discovered in a hotel in Harrogate, claiming to have lost her memory. Lucy Worsley delves into this traumatic watershed moment in Agatha's life. She visits the key locations, from the chalk pit where Agatha crashed her car to Abney Hall, the grand house where she took refuge (and which would inspire several of her books).

Simon Schama examines how the filmmaker Charlie Chaplin and author Ayn Rand created radically different visions of how this new postwar world should work, and how writers such as Rachel Carson drew attention to the damage being inflicted on the natural world.

Twisting and turning along the edge of the Atlantic, life on this ancient coastline is defined by the rhythm of the seasons and the power of the sea. Fishing these fertile waters has long been a tradition here. Every day, local fisherman Jono Voyce heads out from Solva harbour into St Brides Bay to fish for the lobster and crab he supplies to these coastal communities. With the arrival of spring, he will soon be busier than ever, providing for thousands of visitors who flock to this coast every summer for a taste of the sea. By July, beaches are the playground for countless visitors. But their activity depends on the tides. Tides give a predictable rhythm to life on the coast. In Pembrokeshire, where the water level rises as much as 30 feet a day, they are some of the highest in the world.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="40" start="20221231081500 +0000" stop="20221231091500 +0000" catchup-id="900959586"><title>Jay's Yorkshire Workshop</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/gylsYiOz6BuSFvJXu42TgdM9CBm9A6RWXaRwvSi0ZRxN0/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>This week, Jay and his workshop make furniture for a veteran who set up a charity to help other ex-forces members and a couple who have fostered 130 children.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="40" start="20221231091500 +0000" stop="20221231101500 +0000" catchup-id="900959592"><title>Agatha Christie: Lucy Worsley on the Mystery Queen</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/9AHP8X0d9Be4px5MxM9Cz6Mbk59AaAYx4MOP53JkM3EmvRo/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>Lucy Worsley examines Agatha Christie’s later life and discovers how, amid the turbulent social and political change of the 1930s and 40s, newfound personal happiness ushered in a golden age for her writing. In 1930, recovering from a personal crisis, Agatha Christie fell in love with and married Max Mallowan.

Rummaging through antique shops, scrap yards and flea markets, they only have one day to each find those hidden second-hand or used gems that will make them a nice big wedge of cash. Then we follow them as they try to turn these items into gold (or a profit at least). Will Charles ever be able to sell that expensive wooden chest? Can Linda find a buyer for that confessional door? And after her plans go awry, what is Zoe going to do with all those dolls? It's a race against time, as they only have three weeks before their profits are revealed.

He is invited in to see wonderful gardens along the Grand Canal, as well as meeting those who have managed to create a productive garden on a disused rubbish dump behind one of the city's famous churches.

The misty isle is awash with ancient history and jaw-dropping scenery, drawing in 650,000 annual visitors who come to explore its dramatic landscapes. It’s also a favourite with five willing walkers, all hoping their chosen hike will be voted the winning walk of the week. Kicking off the week’s hikes is 57-year-old comedian and tour guide Bruce, who has a passion for history, particularly Skye’s. His walk takes them to two of Skye’s most iconic spots - a woodland walk to Dunvegan Castle, the ancestral home to the celebrated MacCleod clan for 800 years, and then on to stunning jewel of Coral Beach, which appears almost tropical with its clear blue waters and brilliant white sands. Bruce is convinced that these two knockout locations, combined with his surprising stories about their history, will make his walk the winner.

Meanwhile, Amanda’s farm near Abergavenny is home to her beloved Saddleback pigs. Looking after her latest litter of curious piglets is a full-on task, but she is passionate about rearing the best of breed and is a past master in the competition ring. She also wants rosette wins at the Royal Welsh to seal her reputation as a pedigree breeder.

As well as rearing their native breed cattle, they’re proud of the orchards they’ve tended over the decades, which they now use to make award-winning cider and perry. As experienced sellers at Ludlow Food Festival in Shropshire, they know that serving up plenty of samples and flavours will be a magnet for buyers. Meanwhile, for Powys livestock farmers Joanne and Nigel, it’s all hands on deck getting their hot food stand ready for the hungry hordes of festivalgoers. Luckily, their children, now in their twenties, are on hand to help. For both these farming families, the hard work of being at the festival will be worth it if they win the loyalty of new customers and take home a healthy profit to plough back into their businesses.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="40" start="20230112071500 +0000" stop="20230112080000 +0000" catchup-id="901501734"><title>Make It at Market</title><date></date><icon src="https://images.tv.kpn.com/epg/K5FoUmOWiCwKO7caSVrf4ehBtD9AoRCc3ygumtjeYYFk/1920x1080.jpg?blurred=false"></icon><desc>Today’s amateur artisans are jeweller Annelies from Glasgow and woodturner Lucinda from Wiltshire, both heading for Dom’s marquee with high hopes of turning their hobbies into their livelihoods.

In the follow-up to the record-breaking hit comedy, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) travel to exotic Thailand for Stu's wedding. After Doug's now-unforgettable Las Vegas bachelor party, Stu is not taking any chances and has opted for a safe and subdued pre-wedding brunch. Things don't always go as planned however. What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas, but what happens in Bangkok can't even be imagined -- think monkeys, tattoos and the return of Mr. Chow! Acclaimed comedy filmmaker Todd Phillips reunites with his comic quartet of over-indulged stars for another globe-trotting howl at the moon with the `Wolfpack`.","category":""}}

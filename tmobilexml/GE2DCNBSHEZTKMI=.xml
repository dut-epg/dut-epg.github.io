Should it be a social democracy, in which a benevolent state would look after its most vulnerable citizens? Or should it put its faith in individual enterprise and the free market to provide plenty for all? Simon Schama examines how the filmmaker Charlie Chaplin and author Ayn Rand created radically different visions of how this new postwar world should work, and how writers such as Rachel Carson drew attention to the damage being inflicted on the natural world. He talks to author Margaret Atwood about how Carson inspired her own work and to photographer Edward Burtynsky about his photographic projects to document haunting images of the pursuit of consumerism.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221231032000 +0000" stop="20221231035000 +0000" catchup-id="1312153038"><title>B&amp;B by the Sea</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221223/0/202212230200447418be.jpg"></icon><desc>Proud Geordie biker Si King is taking a break from his travels around the world to check into the B&amp;B by the sea.

Twisting and turning along the edge of the Atlantic, life on this ancient coastline is defined by the rhythm of the seasons and the power of the sea. Fishing these fertile waters has long been a tradition here. Every day, local fisherman Jono Voyce heads out from Solva harbour into St Brides Bay to fish for the lobster and crab he supplies to these coastal communities. With the arrival of spring, he will soon be busier than ever, providing for thousands of visitors who flock to this coast every summer for a taste of the sea. By July, beaches are the playground for countless visitors. But their activity depends on the tides. Tides give a predictable rhythm to life on the coast. In Pembrokeshire, where the water level rises as much as 30 feet a day, they are some of the highest in the world.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221231081500 +0000" stop="20221231091500 +0000" catchup-id="1312554634"><title>Jay's Yorkshire Workshop</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221224/41/20221224020049725sop.jpg"></icon><desc>This week, Jay and his workshop make furniture for a veteran who set up a charity to help other ex-forces members and a couple who have fostered 130 children.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20221231091500 +0000" stop="20221231101500 +0000" catchup-id="1312554640"><title>Agatha Christie: Lucy Worsley on the Mystery Queen</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221224/7/20221224020049725pmo.jpg"></icon><desc>Lucy Worsley examines Agatha Christie’s later life and discovers how, amid the turbulent social and political change of the 1930s and 40s, newfound personal happiness ushered in a golden age for her writing.

Britpop at the BBC reminds us all why we were all so proud to be British again in the 1990s.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230101040000 +0000" stop="20230101061500 +0000" catchup-id="1312554718"><title>This is BBC Two</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221224/65/20221224020049726tq7.jpg"></icon><desc>Highlights of programmes on BBC Two.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230101061500 +0000" stop="20230101071000 +0000" catchup-id="1312925519"><title>Countryfile</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221225/69/202212250201199226i6.jpg"></icon><desc>Margherita Taylor is in Auchindrain, a fascinating and remarkably preserved example of a Scottish Highland farm township, to discover the roots and traditions surrounding New Year and Burns Night.

Water has always been the driving force here - its ebb and flow has shaped the fens for thousands of years. The ancient wetlands covered hundreds of square miles and overflowed with wildlife. Today, well over 90% has gone, drained over the centuries and converted into farmland. Yet despite these changes, it is still possible to glimpse the richness of those wetlands. Every winter, thousands of migrating whooper swans return to the flooded pastures of the Ouse washes from their Arctic breeding grounds. Here, they join thousands of other waterfowl in one of Britain's greatest wildlife gatherings. On the Welney Wetlands, spring sees 'mad' march hares boxing over mates.

This collection features Dozier’s best loved and most recognisable hits, performed by the artists like Diana Ross and the Supremes, The Four Tops, and Martha and the Vandellas, who he helped turn into international stars, as well as those who have kept his work alive and relevant to this day including Phil Collins, Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Rag'n'Bone Man.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230101220000 +0000" stop="20230101230000 +0000" catchup-id="1312925591"><title>When Motown Came to Britain</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221225/23/20221225020119922mo7.jpg"></icon><desc>In 1965, some of Motown's brightest new stars, including The Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, arrived in London for a tour that would change the face of British music history. At that time, pop music fans in the UK were unlikely to hear black music on mainstream radio, and names like Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson still meant nothing to most British people. But thousands of miles away from where these exciting new sounds were being recorded in Detroit, a small group of dedicated British music fans had stumbled across the songs and began championing its artists. This is the story of how, by doing so, they paved the way for the first Motown tour of Britain, changing the country's popular culture forever and helping propel the Motown artists to international stardom.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230101230000 +0000" stop="20230102004000 +0000" catchup-id="1312925597"><title>Marvin Gaye: Live at Montreux</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221225/93/20221225020119922zyr.jpg"></icon><desc>Captured during his live appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in July 1980, this highly energetic concert reinforces Marvin Gaye as the undisputed prince of Motown.

Nearby, hard-working tenant farmers Sophie and Tim have brought a full range of dairy and meat, from milkshakes to burgers, to bag as many sales as they can on a hot summer’s day. With young son Henry on the till, Sophie is freed up to go on the charm offensive with potential customers.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230104071500 +0000" stop="20230104080000 +0000" catchup-id="1313961384"><title>Make It at Market</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221228/12/202212282101155089gq.jpg"></icon><desc>Glassblower Belinda from Northamptonshire and upcyclers Becky and Paul from Oxfordshire are hoping Dom and his team can help them turn their passions into profits.

He then samples wine grown in vineyards inside the city limits before visiting a restored public garden with a secret passageway that leads to St Mark's Square.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230106200000 +0000" stop="20230106210000 +0000" catchup-id="1314858060"><title>The Hairy Bikers Go Local</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221230/93/20221230020154715bg8.jpg"></icon><desc>Dave and Si continue their adventure on the east coast of Scotland, on the hunt for new, local ingredients to include on a menu at a beachfront café.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230106210000 +0000" stop="20230106214500 +0000" catchup-id="1314858066"><title>QI XL</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221230/81/202212300201547156h5.jpg"></icon><desc>Sandi has fun with some ticks, a bit of tax, a few toes - and a pile of matchboxes that plays tic-tac-toe with Rose Matafeo, Lou Sanders, Ross Noble and Alan Davies.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230106214500 +0000" stop="20230106223000 +0000" catchup-id="1314858072"><title>Live at the Apollo</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221230/37/20221230020154716bs2.jpg"></icon><desc>The brilliant Ed Gamble introduces comedians Tom Davis and Judi Love to the stage.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230106223000 +0000" stop="20230106230000 +0000" catchup-id="1314858078"><title>Newsnight</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221230/4/202212300201547161r7.jpg"></icon><desc>The day's important national and international news stories.

All in all, a memorable and unique concert that is unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230107223500 +0000" stop="20230108000000 +0000" catchup-id="1315251814"><title>Imagine: Rod Stewart: Can't Stop Me Now</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202212/20221231/58/20221231020145526r09.jpg"></icon><desc>From beatnik to mod, from folkie to disco tart, from glam rocker to, most recently, crooner of American standards, the newly ennobled Sir Roderick Stewart has had a remarkable musical journey.

The misty isle is awash with ancient history and jaw-dropping scenery, drawing in 650,000 annual visitors who come to explore its dramatic landscapes. It’s also a favourite with five willing walkers, all hoping their chosen hike will be voted the winning walk of the week. Kicking off the week’s hikes is 57-year-old comedian and tour guide Bruce, who has a passion for history, particularly Skye’s. His walk takes them to two of Skye’s most iconic spots - a woodland walk to Dunvegan Castle, the ancestral home to the celebrated MacCleod clan for 800 years, and then on to stunning jewel of Coral Beach, which appears almost tropical with its clear blue waters and brilliant white sands. Bruce is convinced that these two knockout locations, combined with his surprising stories about their history, will make his walk the winner. But will the others agree?</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230109190000 +0000" stop="20230109193000 +0000" catchup-id="1315945665"><title>Nadiya's Fast Flavours</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202301/20230102/16/20230102020125514xrm.jpg"></icon><desc>Nadiya injects a joyful spark into our cooking with her flavour-packed comfort food, from a warming beef curry and parathas to custard French toast with pistachio syrup.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141429351" start="20230109193000 +0000" stop="20230109200000 +0000" catchup-id="1315945671"><title>Mastermind</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202301/20230102/90/202301020201255146ut.jpg"></icon><desc>Another four contenders take to the black chair, answering questions on their chosen specialist subjects to earn a place in the semi-finals.

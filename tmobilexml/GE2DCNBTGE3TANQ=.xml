David acted quickly and got in touch with Kym and Ashley, who want to find out more about Louisa to make sure David isn’t getting ripped off. Also, Rachel lost a six-figure sum to a man calling himself Barrio, who claimed to be in the clutches of Russian gangsters.

However, funding their young farm is a constant concern. As first timers at the Royal Welsh Show, they want their Duroc pigs to turn the judge’s head, in particular their favourite boar, Sully. Meanwhile, Amanda’s farm near Abergavenny is home to her beloved Saddleback pigs. Looking after her latest litter of curious piglets is a full-on task, but she is passionate about rearing the best of breed and is a past master in the competition ring. She also wants rosette wins at the Royal Welsh to seal her reputation as a pedigree breeder. Show day brings the hottest temperature ever recorded in Wales, and the pigs need to be kept cool and comfortable while the farmers weather an unpredictable day of judging.</desc><category></category></programme><programme channel="141431706" start="20230110150000 +0000" stop="20230110154500 +0000" catchup-id="1316299869"><title>Escape to the Country</title><date></date><icon src="https://t-mobiletv.nl:443/CPS/images/universal/film/program/202301/20230103/65/20230103020124710il0.jpg"></icon><desc>In the stunning landscapes of north west Wales, Sonali Shah meets a couple from Warwickshire who have a dream of owning a property that would provide them with a home and the ability to offer holiday lets.
